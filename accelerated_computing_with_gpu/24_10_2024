Amdahl's Law
{
[ S = \frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{N}} ]

where:

( S ) is the speedup,
( P ) is the parallelizable fraction of the program,
( N ) is the number of processors.
}

Formula for estimating speedup is named Amdahl's Law

Gustafson's Law
{
[ S = N - (N - 1) \times (1 - P) ]

where:

( S ) is the speedup,
( P ) is the parallelizable fraction of the program,
( N ) is the number of processors.
Gustafson's Law suggests that the speedup can be more significant if the problem size increases with the number of processors.
